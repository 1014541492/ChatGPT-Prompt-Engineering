## 1.介绍

### 1.1 两种大语言模型

(1)Base LLM：基于文本训练数据，预测下一个词

​	数据训练来自互联网和其他来源的大量数据

(2)**lnstruction Tuned LLM**：在指令上进行微调，并努力遵循这些指令

​	从一个基本OM开始，而不是在大量文本数据上进行训练，然后对它进行进一步的训练，使其成为一个精细的单元，并将输出作为指令，并努力遵循这些指令，通常会从人类反馈中强化学习



### 1.2 设置

​	加载 API 密钥和相关的 Python库

```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```



​	辅助函数 使使用提示和查看生成的输出变得更加容易

```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```



## 2.准则

### 2.1 提示原则

**原则1：撰写清晰且具体的指令 （清晰≠简短）**

*(1)策略1：使用定界符来清晰地标记输入的不同部分*

​	三引号 """	三重反引号 ```	三重破折号 ---	尖括号 <>	XML标签 <tag></tag>

​	避免指令与文本歧义，例如文本中出现‘’‘忘记之前的指令’‘’，若没有分隔符可能将文本内容判定为提示

~~~python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
~~~

**output**: 

```
To guide a model towards the desired output and reduce the chances of irrelevant or incorrect responses, it is important to provide clear and specific instructions, which may require longer prompts for more clarity and context.
```



*(2)策略2：要求结构化输出*

​	JSON, HTML

​	例如输出的json结构数据更容易的存放于python程序的字典数据类型中

```python
prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

**output**:

```python
[
  {
    "book_id": 1,
    "title": "The Lost City of Zorath",
    "author": "Aria Blackwood",
    "genre": "Fantasy"
  },
  {
    "book_id": 2,
    "title": "The Last Survivors",
    "author": "Ethan Stone",
    "genre": "Science Fiction"
  },
  {
    "book_id": 3,
    "title": "The Secret of the Haunted Mansion",
    "author": "Lila Rose",
    "genre": "Mystery"
  }
]
```



*(3)策略3：要求模型检查条件是否满足*

​	如果任务有未经证实的假设，我们可以告诉模型如果假设未满足，指示此事并停止，提示该任务未完成，考虑任务未完成的情况

​	考虑潜在特殊情况，应该如何处理以避免出现意外错误或结果

​	按步骤输出制茶过程，缺失的过程进行标记

```python
text_1 = f"""
Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \ 
water boiling. While that's happening, \ 
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \ 
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \ 
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \ 
few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \ 
like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \ 
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \ 
cup of tea to enjoy.
"""
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 1:")
print(response)
```

**output:**

```
Completion for Text 1:
Step 1 - Get some water boiling.
Step 2 - Grab a cup and put a tea bag in it.
Step 3 - Once the water is hot enough, pour it over the tea bag.
Step 4 - Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep.
Step 5 - After a few minutes, take out the tea bag.
Step 6 - Add some sugar or milk to taste.
Step 7 - Enjoy your delicious cup of tea!
```

​	

​	没有过程的文本，提示其输出过程时，若失败，进行相应指定输出

```python
text_2 = f"""
The sun is shining brightly today, and the birds are \
singing. It's a beautiful day to go for a \ 
walk in the park. The flowers are blooming, and the \ 
trees are swaying gently in the breeze. People \

Some are having picnics, while others are playing \ 
games or simply relaxing on the grass. It's a \ 
perfect day to spend time outdoors and appreciate the \ 
beauty of nature.

response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 2:")
print(response)
```

**output:**

```
Completion for Text 2:
No steps provided.
```



*(4)策略4：几次尝试提示*

​	给模型提供执行任务前想要执行的成功示例，在询问之前执行你想要完成的任务操作，让模型执行实际需要它执行的任务

​	例如指定其对话格式像什么样

```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

**output：**

```
<grandparent>: Resilience is like a tree that bends with the wind but never breaks. It is the ability to bounce back from adversity and keep moving forward, even when things get tough. Just like a tree that grows stronger with each storm it weathers, resilience is a quality that can be developed and strengthened over time.
```



**原则2：给模型时间“思考”**

​	问题太复杂，处理时间过短，结果可能瞎猜

*(1)策略 1：指定完成任务所需的步骤*

### 2.2 模型局限性：幻觉

​	在训练过程中接受更多的知识后，LLM并非能够完全记住所见信息，因此它也不能确定自己掌握的知识边界，这意味着它可能会尝试回答关于模糊的问题，甚至可以虚构听起来合理的答案，但实际上并不正确

​	可以通过命令模型对输出内容进行来源追溯，并进行引用以减小幻觉

​	Boie是一家真实的公司，产品名称不是真实的

Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, \
who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and \ 
super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's \ 
a bit small for what I paid though. I think there \ 
might be other options that are bigger for the \ 
same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, \ 
so I got to play with it myself before I gave it \ 
to her.

# review for a standing lamp
review_2 = """
Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one \
had additional storage and not too high of a price \
point. Got it fast - arrived in 2 days. The string \
to the lamp broke during the transit and the company \
happily sent over a new one. Came within a few days \
as well. It was easy to put together. Then I had a \
missing part, so I contacted their support and they \
very quickly got me the missing piece! Seems to me \
to be a great company that cares about their customers \
and products. 
"""

# review for an electric toothbrush
review_3 = """
My dental hygienist recommended an electric toothbrush, \
which is why I got this. The battery life seems to be \
pretty impressive so far. After initial charging and \
leaving the charger plugged in for the first week to \
condition the battery, I've unplugged the charger and \
been using it for twice daily brushing for the last \
3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head \
is too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than \
this one. I wish the head was bigger with different \
length bristles to get between teeth better because \
this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one \
around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's \
replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can \
get generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This \
toothbrush makes me feel like I've been to the dentist \
every day. My teeth feel sparkly clean! 
"""

# review for a blender
review_4 = """
So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.

In a recent survey conducted by the government, 
public sector employees were asked to rate their level 
of satisfaction with the department they work at. 
The results revealed that NASA was the most popular 
department with a satisfaction rating of 95%.

One NASA employee, John Smith, commented on the findings, 
stating, "I'm not surprised that NASA came out on top. 
It's a great place to work with amazing people and 
incredible opportunities. I'm proud to be a part of 
such an innovative organization."

The results were also welcomed by NASA's management team, 
with Director Tom Johnson stating, "We are thrilled to 
hear that our employees are satisfied with their work at NASA. 
We have a talented and dedicated team who work tirelessly 
to achieve our goals, and it's fantastic to see that their 
hard work is paying off."

The survey also revealed that the 
Social Security Administration had the lowest satisfaction 
rating, with only 45% of employees indicating they were 
satisfied with their job. The government has pledged to 
address the concerns raised by employees in the survey and 
work towards improving job satisfaction across all departments.

Title: A Soft and Cute Panda Plushie for All Ages

As an adult, I can attest that pandas are not just for kids. That's why I got this adorable panda plushie for my daughter's birthday, after she kept taking mine from my room. And let me tell you, it was a hit!

The plushie is super soft and cuddly, making it the perfect companion for my daughter. She takes it everywhere with her, and it has quickly become her favorite toy. However, I did notice that one of the ears is a bit lower than the other, which I don't think was designed to be asymmetrical. But that doesn't take away from its cuteness.

The only downside is that it's a bit small for the price I paid. I think there might be other options that are bigger for the same price. But overall, I'm happy with my purchase.

One thing that surprised me was that it arrived a day earlier than expected. This gave me the chance to play with it myself before giving it to my daughter. And I have to say, I was impressed with the quality and attention to detail.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a soft and cute panda plushie for yourself or a loved one, this is definitely a great option. Just be aware that it might be a bit smaller than expected.

So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.
